# YoutubeRedesignReact

Personal Challenge Project 2 for Front End Design.

Followed the design template from UpLabs' Marcus Hofer [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/youtube-redesign-ii).

This project reimagines Youtube's web UI. The addition of React.JS means the content is updated as soon as the user enters in a search query.
